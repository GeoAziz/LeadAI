# Test User Credentials

This application uses Firebase Authentication, so there are no hardcoded users.

## How to Create a Test User:

1.  **Navigate to the application's login page.**
2.  **Click on the "Create your operator credentials" or "Create one" link.**
3.  **Use the signup form to create a new user account with your desired email and password.**
4.  **Once created, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard.**

You can then use these credentials to log in on subsequent visits.
