## Style Guidelines:

- Dark UI base with jet black / space navy (#00001A) background to evoke the depth of space.
- Electric neon gradients, primarily cyan (#00FFFF), purple (#800080), and magenta (#FF00FF), to add high-tech accents.
- Use a desaturated color similar in hue to the primary gradients, around (#1A1A33) to serve as an accent color; give elements like cards a subtle lift.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy feel.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets.
- Incorporate hologram UI effects: glows, pulses, and blurred overlays.
- Use animated data flows with dots, lines, and waveforms; also subtle animations when displaying the data
